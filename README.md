# üåê ProxyModule

**ProxyModule** is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for scraping and validating free proxies from the web. Whether you're a beginner just getting started or an expert looking to integrate proxy functionality into your projects, ProxyModule has you covered! üéâ

## üöÄ Features
- **Asynchronous Scraping**: Quickly scrape proxies from multiple sources.
- **Proxy Validation**: Validate scraped proxies against a target website.
- **Modular Design**: Easily integrate into your own projects or use as a standalone tool.
- **Colorful Logging**: Get clear and colorful logs to track the process.

## üîç Proxy Validation URL

In the `validate_proxies` function of `proxy_scraper.py`, the URL `https://www.example.com/` is used as a test endpoint for proxy validation. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

### What It's For
- **Validation**: This URL serves as a placeholder to test if the proxies are functioning correctly. A proxy that can successfully fetch the page with a 200 status code is considered valid.

### How to Change It
- **Customization**: To test proxies against a specific website or service, replace `https://www.example.com/` with your desired URL. This change can be made in the `validate_proxies` function in `proxy_scraper.py`.

### How It Affects Things
- **Accuracy**: The chosen URL can impact the accuracy of proxy validation. Using a URL similar to your target application's will give you a better idea of how well proxies will perform in real-world scenarios. For example, if you're using proxies for accessing a specific website, you might test against a page from that site.

## üìÑ Integration Guide

### üî∞ Beginner Integration

If you‚Äôre new to integrating modules and just want to use **ProxyModule** in your own projects, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Include the Module**:
   - Copy the `proxy_scraper.py` file into your project directory.

2. **Use the Module in Your Script**:
   - Import the functions you need from `proxy_scraper.py` into your script:
     ```python
     from proxy_scraper import scrape_proxies, validate_proxies
     ```
   - Example usage:
     ```python
     import asyncio
     from proxy_scraper import scrape_proxies, validate_proxies

     async def main():
         proxies = await scrape_proxies()
         valid_proxies = await validate_proxies(proxies)
         print(f"Total valid proxies found: {len(valid_proxies)}")

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         asyncio.run(main())
     ```

3. **Run Your Script**:
   - Execute your script using Python:
     ```bash
     python your_script.py
     ```

### üí° Expert Integration

For more advanced users who want to deeply integrate **ProxyModule** into their projects:

1. **Clone and Add the Module**:
   - Clone the repository or copy the `proxy_scraper.py` file into your project.

2. **Customize the Proxy Sources**:
   - Modify the `scrape_proxies` function in `proxy_scraper.py` to include or exclude proxy sources based on your needs.

3. **Advanced Usage**:
   - Import and use the module with more complex logic, such as integrating proxy validation into larger workflows or combining it with other modules:
     ```python
     from proxy_scraper import scrape_proxies, validate_proxies

     async def perform_advanced_operations():
         # Fetch proxies
         proxies = await scrape_proxies()

         # Validate proxies with custom logic
         valid_proxies = await validate_proxies(proxies, validation_url="https://your-custom-url.com/")
         
         # Process valid proxies further
         for proxy in valid_proxies:
             print(f"Processing valid proxy: {proxy}")

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         asyncio.run(perform_advanced_operations())
     ```

4. **Integration with Other Systems**:
   - Integrate the module with web scraping frameworks, API clients, or other systems where proxy usage is essential.
